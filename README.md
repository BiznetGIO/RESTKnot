# RESTKnot

Manage DNS records with simple APIs.

RESTKnot provide a high-level asynchronous API to existing Knot DNS server. This project consists of
three applications : RESTKnot agent, RESTKnot API, and RESTKnot CLI. A user can
create DNS record through web API provided by RESTKnot API, or as command line
app using RESTKnot CLI. Both of them send command to RESTKnot agent which will
be translated into Knot DNS action.
