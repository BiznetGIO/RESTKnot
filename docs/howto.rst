How Toâ€™s
========

Create New Zone
---------------

To create new zone you first need to register using :code:`/user/add` then crate new
zone with :code:`/domain/add`. This will create SOA, NS, and CNAME record for you.


Add/Edit/Remove spesific Record
-------------------------------

To add/edit/remove specific record you can use :code:`/record/add`,
:code:`/record/edit/:record_id`, and :code:`record/delete/:record_id`

.. note::
     RESTKnot handles SOA serial incremental automatically, so you don't need to
     hassle. But if the record you manage is SOA, you have to increment the serial
     manually.

To remove zone completely, which will remove all records. You can use :code:`/domain/delete`
